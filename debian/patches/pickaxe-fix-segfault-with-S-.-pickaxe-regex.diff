Subject: pickaxe: fix segfault with '-S<...> --pickaxe-regex'

'git {log,diff,...} -S<...> --pickaxe-regex' can segfault as a result
of out-of-bounds memory reads.

diffcore-pickaxe.c:contains() looks for all matches of the given regex
in a buffer in a loop, advancing the buffer pointer to the end of the
last match in each iteration.  When we switched to REG_STARTEND in
b7d36ffca (regex: use regexec_buf(), 2016-09-21), we started passing
the size of that buffer to the regexp engine, too.  Unfortunately,
this buffer size is never updated on subsequent iterations, and as the
buffer pointer advances on each iteration, this "bufptr+bufsize"
points past the end of the buffer.  This results in segmentation
fault, if that memory can't be accessed.  In case of 'git log' it can
also result in erroneously listed commits, if the memory past the end
of buffer is accessible and happens to contain data matching the
regex.

Reduce the buffer size on each iteration as the buffer pointer is
advanced, thus maintaining the correct end of buffer location.
Furthermore, make sure that the buffer pointer is not dereferenced in
the control flow statements when we already reached the end of the
buffer.

The new test is flaky, I've never seen it fail on my Linux box even
without the fix, but this is expected according to db5dfa3 (regex:
-G<pattern> feeds a non NUL-terminated string to regexec() and fails,
2016-09-21).  However, it did fail on Travis CI with the first (and
incomplete) version of the fix, and based on that commit message I
would expect the new test without the fix to fail most of the time on
Windows.
